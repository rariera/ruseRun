RuseRun is a classic rogue-like game set at the school of James Ruse. In the game, the user must endeavour to make their way from the bottom of the farm to the front gates, which are the only surviving exit. But there’s a catch – the exit itself will close in a mere 2 hours, trapping you inside the school. And though a long time that may seem, there are many within the school who would see you trapped inside forever. Will you succeed where so many have failed, and escape from the school? For I fear that if you should fail, that we are all doomed.
